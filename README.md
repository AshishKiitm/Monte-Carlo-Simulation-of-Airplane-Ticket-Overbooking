# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:
Airline Companies usually oversell tickets to maximize the profits of each scheduled flight. However the exact number of overselling tickets is uncertain, which is very significant to be kept in a reasonable range. If overbooking numbers are not well controlled, it will lead to finance compensation and customer loss due to the absence of seats for excess passengers, or profit loss due to low seat utilization.

So in this model. we will simulate the real-world airline booking scenario based on Monte Carlo simulation principle to find out the best overbooking number range and purse the maximum profits for a company.



## Simulation's variables of uncertainty
List and describe your simulation's variables of uncertainty (where you're using pseudo-random number generation). For each such variable, how did you decide the range and probability distribution to use?  Do you think it's a good representation of reality?

## Hypothesis or hypotheses before running the simulation:

## Analytical Summary of your findings: (e.g. Did you adjust the scenario based on previous simulation outcomes?  What are the management decisions one could make from your simulation's output, etc.)

## Instructions on how to use the program:
