# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:
Airline Companies usually oversell tickets to maximize the profits of each scheduled flight. However the exact number of overselling tickets is uncertain, which is very significant to be kept in a reasonable range. If overbooking numbers are not well controlled, it will lead to finance compensation and customer loss due to the absence of seats for excess passengers, or profit loss due to low seat utilization.

So in this model. we will simulate the real-world airline booking scenario based on Monte Carlo simulation principle to find out the best overbooking number range and purse the maximum profits for a company.



## Simulation's variables of uncertainty
We will take all the following variable into condiseration, which are related to the profits of a single airline flight.
Number of passangers who booked the flight
# The seats of a single flight
# The probability that the passangers who booked the flight will take on the plane
# The profits of each ticket
# The finance compensation to excess passengers who do not have a seat and the finance loss of losing future costumers
# The profit loss of unused seats

tips:List and describe your simulation's variables of uncertainty (where you're using pseudo-random number generation). For each such variable, how did you decide the range and probability distribution to use?  Do you think it's a good representation of reality?

## Hypothesis or hypotheses before running the simulation:
The hypothesis is that within a certain range, the profits will grow following the overbooking numbers' increasement. Then there is a peak to achieve the maximum profits, however the profits will begin to drop after the peak as the overselling keep increaing.

## Analytical Summary of your findings: (e.g. Did you adjust the scenario based on previous simulation outcomes?  What are the management decisions one could make from your simulation's output, etc.)
